# CodeRefactoring


<b>DRY </b>: Think about DRY principle when you are making duplicate code and similar logics.

         1) Try to breakdown the method logic into smaller one
         2) SOLID and design patterns helps to avoid duplicate logic
         3) Think about Generics, parameterized methods, varargs if same logic doesn't fall into different usecases
